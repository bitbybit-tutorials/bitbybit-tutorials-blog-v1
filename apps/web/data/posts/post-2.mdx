Push notifications are great!

They are great for businesses as they help grow customer relationships and engagement by creating and delivering fast, highly relevant and personalised experiences to users.

They are great for users because they let you stay up to date with the latest information, updates, or deals from your favourite products and services.
Want to know when your Deliveroo chicken burrito bowl is coming? No problem!
Want to get notified when your favourite Youtube creator releases a new video? Here you go! Want to receive a discount voucher for Nike's latest collection? You go it!

What's not so great, is having to set up a push notifications infrastructure from scratch and manage everything on you own. A much wiser option is to select an already established push notifications service that will do all the heavy lifting for you.

Enter Airship!

## What is Airship?

[Airship](https://docs.airship.com/) is a platform for customer engagement, analytics and data solutions and offers notification and messaging solutions across many different channels - apps, web browsers, email, SMS, etc.

Why choose Airship? Here are some of my own personal considerations:

- Really easy to get started - Airship offers a 1st Flight app which can be installed to send some test notifications.
- Developer friendly SDK for multiple platforms, and most importantly in our case React Native. It supports powerful out of the box features such as Message Center which is a place in the app where you can display persistent rich messages, including HTML and videos.
- Feature-rich dashboard which can be used for managing projects, testing, creating message templates, scheduling messages, segmenting audiences, developing engagement journeys, reporting and much more.
- Versatile API that supports most dashboard features. We can use that to segment users and send regular and silent push notifications programatically.
